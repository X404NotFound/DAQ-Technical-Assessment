# Brainstorming
Part1
However part 1 is fairly simple, just by adding try and catch block would fix the problem, since the format being sent by data-emulator might be wrong. So i print out the error message to make sure we know what is going wrong while still making the server running.

Part2
For part2 I understand the question in a way that there is a 5 seconds window we are consistently checking whether in this window there are more than 3 timestamp where the tempreture is out of the safe range.


Part4
1. eslint
Since data-emulator file can not be changed, so I assume the correct indentation is 4, I also let eslint ignore this file to prevent it from being changed by lint-fix by adding the file name to .eslintignore.
